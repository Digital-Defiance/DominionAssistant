# Unofficial Dominion Assistant

Welcome to the **Unofficial Dominion Assistant**, a React application designed to enhance your gameplay experience for the popular card game, Dominion! This tool provides comprehensive features for game management, scoring, and player interaction, allowing Dominion enthusiasts to focus on strategy and enjoyment.

Unofficial Dominion Assistant is a free tool which aimed to support the main features of the game and the ones we used personally. Many of the specfific expansions and cards are not specifically supported but should allow for manual adjustment to accommodate them.
Please see our GitHub [issues](https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/DominionAssistant/issues) page for our roadmap/upcoming features and to make requests.

## Disclaimer for End Users

This software runs entirely in the browser and should not affect the local machine, but game state may not be accurately tracked and may affect the outcome of games. This tool should not (yet?) be relied upon for tournaments or anything where it is not being used for personal use. The project is provided "as-is" without any warranties or guarantees. Use at your own risk. The authors are not responsible for any damage or data loss that may occur from using this software.

Especially as a free tool, we make no guarantees, waranty, or promises of bug-free accuracy or that we will implement all suggestions. Our time is limited and this project is made and run for free. If you'd like to donate to [Digital Defiance](https://digitaldefiance.org) to facilitate specific features or support development, that would be greatly appreciated. Donations will not be refunded and we make no guarantees that a donation will ensure a requested change is made, though we will certainly make the effort if possible.

Please note that the Unofficial Dominion Assistant is not affiliated with or endorsed by the makers of Dominion or Donald X Vaccarino. This application is a fan-built project created to enhance your gameplay experience and requires ownership of the physical Dominion game to use. It does not allow you to play without having the original game. The use of the Dominion logo is intended solely for personal use to support the Dominion community and should be considered under the _Fair Use Doctrine_.

### Fair Use Doctrine

Under _17 U.S.C. § 107_, fair use allows limited use of copyrighted material without requiring permission from the rights holders. Factors to consider include:

- The purpose and character of the use (e.g., educational, non-commercial).
- The nature of the copyrighted work.
- The amount and substantiality of the portion used.
- The effect of the use on the potential market for the original work.

**Case References**:

- In _Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc._, 510 U.S. 569 (1994), the U.S. Supreme Court emphasized that transformative uses of copyrighted material could qualify as fair use.
- In _Lentz v. Morrow_, 104 Cal.App.3d 392 (1980), the court upheld that using copyrighted material in a manner that requires the original for use is less likely to infringe on the copyright holder’s rights.

Our application, as a fan-built tool that does not replicate the game, could be argued as transformative.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 20.9.0 or higher)
- yarn (version 1.22.22 or higher)
- NX CLI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/DominionAssistant.git
   ```

From here you may follow the instructions below or jump to the section on Dev Container usage.

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    yarn start
   ```

A popup should offer to open the application in a browser.

### Visual Studio Code Dev Container Preqrequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for VS Code

### Development with VS Code Dev Container

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/DominionAssistant.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Set up .env:

- Copy the .env.example in the project root to .env
- Fill in the CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN from https://app.codacy.com/gh/Digital-Defiance/DominionAssistant/settings/coverage
- Fill in the FONTAWESOME_KEY from https://fontawesome.com/kits/1111eb8cf6/package
- Save the .env file

4. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or use the command palette (F1) and select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container".
5. VS Code will build the dev container and set up the environment. This may take a few minutes the first time.
6. Once the container is ready, open a new terminal in VS Code and run:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
7. Start the app:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

A popup should offer to open the application in a browser.

### Preferred Development Environment

We highly recommend using Visual Studio Code Dev Containers/Docker for a consistent and isolated development environment. This ensures that all dependencies and configurations are standardized across different development setups.

The devcontainer.json postCreateCommand will run through setup of NVM to select a desired version of Node, perform the yarn install, and install the nx cli globals.

## Usage

Once the application is started with yarn start-

The app consists of several main screens:

1. Home Screen
2. Dominion Assistant (main game screen)
3. Game Log
4. Load/Save Game

Navigate through these screens using the tab bar at the bottom of the app.

To start a new game:

1. Add player names
2. Set game options (including expansions and special rules)
3. Start the game and use the interface to track scores, turns, and game events

## Development

Other commands available:

- yarn start: Starts the development server
- yarn build: Builds the app using NX
- yarn test:jest: Runs Jest tests
- yarn test:jest:single: Runs a single specified test (eg yarn test:jest:single src/game/**tests**/dominion-lib-load-save-saveGame.spec.ts)
- yarn test:playwright: Runs playwright e2e tests
- yarn test:playwright:report: Shows the playwright report
- yarn lint:eslint: Runs ESLint
- yarn lint:eslint:fix: Runs ESLint with auto-fix option
- yarn lint:prettier:fix: Runs Prettier to format various file types
